what is singleton architure?

The singleton Architecture is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. 
We create singleton class since teh requirement of the different classes are same then we create a 
singleton class which creates only on object and this object is shared by different classes 
For eg. we can crete an object of webdriver in singleton class and webdriver object is shared by different classes.
