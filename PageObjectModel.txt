What is page object model ?

Page Object Model is a design pattern which we follow while developing the framework.
In this type of framework for every page of the web application we create a page class where 
using the different locators we find webelements of that particular page ,for this we use 
@FindBy annotation and we also define the methods related to those webelements. So every page acts
as object repository for that particular page .
We also have a base class which is created in another package where we define all the global properties such as setting up the system properties 
of the browser, maximizing the browser, pageload timeout, teardown methods etc. and this base class is inherited by
by all the page class apart from that we also create a test class in different package related to each page .To test we 
integrate testNG.In the test class we use PageFactory class to initialize webelements using initElements
using .class extension .
For eg. 
LoginPage loginpage=PageFactory.initElements(driver,LoginPage.class)
the above statement returns the object of the particular page. we also have pom.xml file where we define all the dependency
required for the project for eg. ApachePoi, testNG etc.
