what is method overloading ?
Method overloading is nothing but static polymorphism where two or more
 methods have same method name but different number and/or type of arguments.
Here method call is decided during compile time.
 for example:
suppose in a class there is a method called add() of return type int that accepts 
two int variables as parameters and returns there sum. Suppose in the same class 
there is another add method of return type int that accepts three integer variables
as parameters and returns there sum.Here the two methods are an example of method 
overloading because both the methods have same name, add, but one of them accepts two 
parameters while the other accepts three.
