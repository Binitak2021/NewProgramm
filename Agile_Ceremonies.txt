what are agile ceremonies?

In Agile methodology of project development we have differenet ceremonies which are a part of project development.
They are:
Sprint planning meeting:In this meeting the project owner,the scrum master and the developers are part of this
meeting,Here the P.O. prioritizes the user stories which are nothing but the smallest unit of requirements, which
is taken from the product backlog and puts them into sprint backlog.After the user stories are prioritized, all the team 
members estimates the effort needed to complete the user stroy in the form of story pts and using planning pocker 
technique we give the story pts in fibonacci series no and finally the team commits the chunk of work to complete
in given period of time.

Daily Standup meeting- Once the user stories are decided , we have daily standup meeting which are attended by scrum master
developers and BA .it usually happens for 15 mins where every team memeber talks what task have we done yesterday,what are
we going to do today and are there any impediment which we are facing, here we use kanban board. Also this meeting helps 
everyone to make aware what progress we are having on daily basis, and who is doing what in the project.

Sprint review meeting-This meeting occurs when we have completed the user stroies in the given sprint and its time to showcase 
the work , Here the meeting is attended by BA,Scrum Master, PO, Developers, and also the stakeholders. This meeting gives the
opportunity to get direct feedback from the client as every body in the team collectively showcases the work.

Retrospective meeting-This meeting is attended by the P.O.,Scrum Master,BA, Developers. This is the most important meeting as it helps us 
to improve our process. We will discuss what went well and how well we have performed and if there were any issues what was the reason, 
How can we avoid those issues in the upcoming sprints.This is the last ceremony of the sprint.
