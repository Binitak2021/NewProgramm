How continuous Integration is achieved in jenkins?

Ans: In our company we have used jenkins as contiuous integration tool.
In jenkins code is continuously tested after commit to ensure there are no bugs,
Here the developers will commit their code and once the code is commited a build
is created on jenkins, and once the build is created the developers build is 
executed first and once the developer build is executed successfully, then testers 
build is executed , so the test build is launched on the fresh code which has got 
the latest code , and once the test automation is complete we get the report to find if
the bugs are present. This is how continuous integration happens in our company and 
achieved in this form.
