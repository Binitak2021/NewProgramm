Defect life cycle is the lifecycle of the bug from the point it is logged in to the 
point it is closed.

 tracking tool.

 the test lead will be assigned to the development 
team and the status will be chanded to Assigned.
3.Open-When the bug is assigned to the developer and he starts annalyzing it ,that it
 is the time he changes the status of the bug to open.
4.Fixed-Once the developer has made necessary code changes and fixed the developer 
changes the bug status to fixed and the bug is passed to the testing team. 
5.Retesting-The bug comes back to the tester for retesting in order to ensure that the 
bug has been fixed.This is the time the tester changes the bug status to REtesting
6.Reopen- In case if the bug still persist after the developer has fixed the bug , then
 the status of the bug is Reopen, and the above steps will repeat once again.But if the 
bug is no longer present then the tester assignes the status as verified.
